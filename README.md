# pyanova
A Python 3 library for programmatically accessing WiFi-enabled Anova sous vide cookers through the Anova API.

**NOTE**: This library uses the Anova REST API and has been tested with the Anova Precision Cooker Pro. Make sure your Anova cooker supports WiFi and is already connected.

## Installation
First, clone the GitHub repository:
`git clone https://github.com/ammarzuberi/pyanova.git`

Enter the newly created `pyanova` directory and run:
`pip install .`

This should install pyanova on your system. You can use it in your own Python scripts like so:
`import anova`

## Cooker ID
To use pyanova, you will have to find your cooker ID. This can be easily found in the Anova app when your cooker is connected to WiFi.

On the profile page, click the settings button (top right of the page, cog icon) and choose "Cooker Details."
